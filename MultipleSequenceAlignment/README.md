### Overview:
Use multiple sequence aligners (Chowdhury and Garai 2017), download orthologs of the APOE gene from multiple species, write a python3/BioPython script `translate_APOE.py` to translate the nucleotide sequences to amino acid sequences  `apoe_aa.fasta`, and write a script `clustalAlign.sh` to use Clustal Omega  to perform a multiple sequence alignment of the orthologs.
